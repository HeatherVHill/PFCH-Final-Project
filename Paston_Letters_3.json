And in case my lord woll not supporte  the seid Paston in his right, but be indifferent athwyx bothe parties, that  thanne it please my lord to haue consideracion to the right of the mater  as folowyth in articles, and  Page \u00a0115therupon to be remembird whedir it be resonably desired by Will Jenney  or by Debenham as his waged man, or for his sake, that Paston shuld  leve the possession or the takyng of the profitez of the seid maner. First,  to be remembird that the seid maner, aswell as the maner of Nakton,  were Ser John Fastolffes, and that the seid Paston of the seid maners  toke estate at Cotton and atornement of the tenauntes viij or ix yere goo,  in such wise as the tenauntes can reporte, and continued there in  possession aswell in the live of the seid Ser John as sithen, and hath take  the profitez therof sith the discese of the seid Fastolff except for the  terme of Mighelmes a yere passed, whech tyme the tenauntes were  compellid by fors of distresses to pay ayens ther willes part of the seid  profitez. And that also the title of the seid Paston to the seid maner is  not all only by the seid feffement, but aswell by a graunt and bargeyn  mad a-thwyx the seid Fastolff and the seid Paston as by the last will of  the seid Fastolff, whereby the seid Paston ought to take the hole profitez  of the seid maner. And also it is lefull to the seid Paston to kepe the seid  maner with fors, consideryng he hath be in possession iij yere and more;  hough be it the seid Paston intendyth to kepe the seid maner pesibly and  non otherwise [unclear] . And that the pretense and cleyme of the seid Jenney is  that he shuld be infeffed with the seid Paston in the seid maner, by  whech pretense, if it were trewe, yet the seid Paston by reason shuld not  be put out of the seid maner; for who som evir had titell therto by  feffement or by executrie, Paston shuld be on that had title. Hough be it  the seid Paston cleymyth not in that forme, but by the titell of his  bargeyn and by the seid Fastolffes will.  Item, to be remembird  whech tyme as my lord had wretyn his lettirs and sent his seruauntes for  the eyde and supporte of the seid Paston to take the profitez of the seid  maner of Nakton as of the maner of Cotton, desyryn [deleted in MS]g the tenauntis to  the seid Paston, the seid Jenney wold haue no consideracion therto;  hough be it, though he were a feff\u00e9 he had no titell to take the  seid profitez, consideryng he is non executor; but presumptuosly, havyng  no consideracion to my lordes lettir ner sendyng, compellid the tenauntes  by distresses to pay hym more besely thanne any  Page \u00a0116feff\u00e9 or executor, and now at this same tyme hath be at Nakton  and reseyvid as moch mony as he coud gader there.  Item, where  at Mighelmesse the yere passed the seid Paston sent his sone, a seruaunt  of my lordes, and also Richard Calle, seruaunt to the seid Paston put to  hym by my lordes fader, to reseyve the profitez of the seid maner as thei  had do many yeres befo [unclear] re, the seid Jenney ded arest the seid Calle  for a thef, and as a thef caried hym, to th' entent that the tenauntes shuld  be discoraged to pay the seid Paston; whech tyme, at the request of the  seid Calles kynred, it pleased my lord to write to the seid Jenney and  Debenham for the deliuerauns of the seid Calle, to whech letteris they  nouther toke hede ner reputacion bu [unclear] t by that sotilt\u00e9 reseyved  the profitez of the seid maner, the seid Paston havyng non help by my  seid lordes writyng ner sendyng. Wherfore, please my lordes good  lordship to supporte the seid Paston in kepyng of his right and possession  till it be dispreved or knowe onlawfull, and the seid Paston will applye  to such meanes as it pleasith my lord to take wherby the right of the  mater may be vndirstand and determined. And also that it like my lord to  remembir that it is not behofefull for any prinse lightly to geve trust or  to applye to the desires of any persones that haue geve hym cause of  mistrust.  "

I recomaund me to yow, and haue reseyvid ij lettirs from John  Russe wherin he remembirth me that I shuld owe hym xix li. or  ther-upon for diuers parcelles whech he seith he shuld haue deliuerid  in-to myn hows, wherof he seith xiiij li. was deliuerid in-to myn howse  ij yere goo [unclear]  and that I had a bille deliuerid me therof, and the  remnaunt sithen, and desireth of me payment of the seid xix li.;  wherfore I certifye [unclear]  yow as I vndirstand in the mater. Ye may lete  John Russe come to yow and take such a direccion in the mater as  reason and trought woll. I lete yow wete that abought ij yere goo the  seid John Russe deliuerid me first a bille of the seid xiiij li. [unclear] , and I  examined the parcelles; and as I remembir xj li. was my dewt\u00e9,  wherof the certeyn somme is writen in my blak book of foreyn reseytes  that yere, and the remnaunt was Richard Calles dewt\u00e9, wherof he  was allowed, savyng a part was Elys dewt\u00e9. And  Page \u00a0137\nas for the seid xj li., I offerid the seid John Russe payment in hand at  \u00feat tyme and desired hym he shuld nomore send in-to myn howse,  and warnyd yow and Richard that ye shuld nomore stuffe take in-to myn  hows without ye paijd in hand, nowther of hym ner of non other. And  the seid John Russe praijd me to remembir that I had graunted hym the  maner of Akthorp in Leystoft at a certeyn prise, as it apperyd by writyng  vndir my seall, and desired me that I wold take the seid somme in party  of payment. And I told hym that, as for such mony that shuld come from  hym for that lond, I wold take it of hym and ley it vp by the self, that I  myght purchase other lond therwith, bicause I wold lesse Fastolffes  lyuelode for the college; but I wold pay hym his dewt\u00e9 without  any stoppage. And he thanne desired me to take \u00feat same xj li.  and ley it vp to the same vse, seying to me that it was as good to do so  as I for to take it hym and he to take it me ayen. And thus he and I  agreed and departed, and thanne he praijd me to take more chafar of  hym, whech I denyed. And nough I merveyll what shuld cause hym to  aske mony for that dewt\u00e9. Neuirethelesse I deme he supposith  that he coud not opteyne his bargeyn by me bicause of the trobill that it  standyth in, and for that or for some other cause he repentyth his  bargeyn and woll nomore of it. Wherfore send for hym, and take James  Gresham or some of your frendes and Richard Calle, and fele what he  menyth; and if ye can fynd hym disposed to leve his bargeyn, yet though  I myght kepe stille the seid mony, I wold he shuld not lese therby.  Neuirthelesse, if he woll refuse his bargeyn, thanne take ayen the  writyng that he hath of that bargeyn and a writyng of his hand that he  dischargyth me of the graunt that I mad hym of that same bargeyn. And  thanne loke that ye enquere what mony he hath reseyvid of the seid  maner in my tyme, wherof the ferme is vj li. yerly, whech I suffird hym  to occupie to his owne vse by fors of the seid bargeyn all my tyme; and  aftir the parcellis cast what I haue had of hym, abbate \u00feerof the  mony that he hath reseyvid of the seid maner and also as moch of the  xiiij li. as the seid Richard Calle and Elys owen, wherof he is allowid,  and thanne see that the seid John Russe be content of the remnaunt of his  parcellis that is dew by me; but loke ye pay non other mennes  dewt\u00e9s. Also the seid John Russe writyth in his lettir that, rather  thanne he shuld fayle this mony, that I wold lend hym asmoch to pay  ayen at Cristemasse; wherfore, if he leve his bargeyn, I woll ye lend  hym asmoch mony over his dewt\u00e9 as shall make vp xx li., takyng  of hym suert\u00e9 to pay ayen at Cristemasse, as he writyth. In case  be that he will kepe stille his  Page \u00a0138bargeyn, thanne ye may answere hym it is no reason that he shuld aske  me any part of that mony ayen, for he owyth that and moch more.

And I pray  yow remembir ij thynges: on, if ye fynd hym in any maner wise  disposed to leve his bargeyn, take it at his offer and take ayen the  writyng that he hath of that bargeyn, or a writyng of his owne hand of  relesyng his bargeyn to me; for paraventure at this tyme he woll be glad  to leve his bargeyn, as I vndirstand, and whanne he sethe that I haue  peas he woll calle ther-on ayen, wherfore I pray yow werk wisely herin,  for he may in no maner wise aske the mony of me and kepe his bargeyn,  for he hath diuers  Page \u00a0139tymes desired me to haue take of hym more stuffe \u00feerfore;  a-nother, as sone as ye may, or ye breke this mater with John Russe,  make due serche with the fermours at Akthorp what mony Russe hath  reseyvid there in my tyme: that is to sey for Mighelmes the first, the ij,  iij, iiij yeres of Kyng E., of whech he hath reseyvid ij paymentes, that is  xij li. at the lest, or er the maner was trobelid by Jenney or Yeluerton.  And I deme that he hath reseyvid some sithen, but that he kepith  counsell.  Item, for asmoch as Ser Thomas Howes gaderid for the  xxxix yere of Kyng Herry, the seid John Russe woll, vnder colour of  that, surmytte that he reseyvid in my tyme was therfore; wherfore ye  must make a serche what he hath reseyvid sith Ser John Fastolff dyed,  and what tyme, and therupon ye shall vndirstand what he hath reseyvid  for me and what for hym. And in case he hath reseyvid xij li. and  Richard hath paijd hym his dut\u00e9 as he promised, thanne growyth  nat to John Russe past iiij or v li. Notwithstandyng, fare fayre with hym  and resonabilly, so \u00feat he leve his bargeyn, and lend hym the  remnaunt of the xx li. vpon suert\u00e9 for xx li. he desireth to haue  outher by dewt\u00e9 or borowyng at this tyme.  Item, he that  shall speke with the fermours of Akthorp, whos name is Langham, he  must inquere generally what mony he hath paijd to all men sith Ser John  Fastolff dyed, and see his billes of payment and take therof a titelyng.  Richard Calle hath a bille of parcellis of euery mannes ferme, and he can  serche this best in case he be not to favorabill to John Russe; wherfore I  remitte this to your discrecion. But I suppose John Russe woll telle yow  what he hath reseyvid, for I [deleted in MS] haue bifore this tyme wretyn by his seying  what he had reseyvid, and I suppose and he remembird that he seid to  me he wold not aske his mony in this forme. Neuirthelesse it shall do  good so he leve his bargeyn by this meane. I merveyll that I here no  tidyngges from yow hough ye haue do at the assises. The berer of this  lettir is a comon carier and was at Norwich on Satirday, and brought me  lettirs from other men; but your seruauntes inquere nat diligently after  the comyng of cariers and other men.

        "Content": "To my cosyn Margret Paston. Myn owne dere souereyn lady, I recomaund me to yow and thank  yow of the gret chere \u00feat ye mad me here, to my gret cost and  charge and labour. Nomore at this tyme but that I pray yow ye woll send  me hedir ij elne of worsted for doblettes to happe me this cold wynter,  and that ye inquere where William Paston bought his tepet of fyne  worsted whech is almost like silk; and if that be moch fyner thanne  \u00feat ye shuld bye me after vij or viij s., thanne bye m [unclear] e a  quarter and the nayle therof for colers, thow it be derrer thanne the  tother, for I wold make my doblet all worsted for worship of Norffolk  rather thanne like Gonnores doblet.  Item, as for the mater of the  ix xx li. askyd by my lady of Bedford for the maner of Westthurrok,  where as Ser Thomas Howes seith that he hath no writyng therof but  \u00feat Ser John Fastolff purchased the seid maner and paijd certeyn  mony in ernest, and aftirward grauntyd his bargeyn to the Duc of  Bedford, and so the mony \u00feat he toke was for the mony that he  had paijd; paraventure Ser Thomas hath writyng therof and knowyth it  not, for if ther be any such mony paijd vpon any bargeyn he shall fynd it  in Kyrtelyngges bookes \u00feat was Ser John Fastolffes reseyvour.  And it was abought such tyme as the Duc of Bedford was last in  Inglond, whech as it is told me was the viij yere of Kyng Herry the Fift  or the viij yere of Kyng Herry the Sext, and the somme that he paijd for  the seid bargeyn was ccc mark. Also he shall fynd, the xxij yere of Kyng  Herry or therabought, in the acomptes of on of Fastolffes reseyvours at  London, that ther was take of Ser Thomas Tyrell and of the Duchesse of  Excestre, that was wif to Ser Lowes John, fermours of the seid maner,  certeyn mony for repayment of part of the seid ccc mark. Also he shall  fynd in yeres after \u00feat, or in that yere or ther-aboutes, that Ser  John Fastolff reseyved mony of my Lord Revers \u00feat now is, by  the name of Richard Wydevile,  Page \u00a0141for his owne dette dew to Ser John Fastolff. Wherfore if Ser Thomas be  trewe to his master lete hym do his devoir to make \u00feat Worseter,  whech is vphold be hym with the dedes goodes, to be trewe to his  master; or ellis it is tyme for Ser Thomas to forsake hym and help to  punyssh hym, or men must sey that Ser Thomas is not trewe. And  more-ouer lete Ser Thomas examine what he can fynd in this mater that I  sent hym word of, whech mater he shall fynd in the seid reseyvours  bookes, if he list to seke it.  Item, wete of hym whedir any writte  of  sub pena cam to hym therfore.  Item, I  send hym a bille whech on Edmond Carvyle for Robert Otteley askyth of  Ser John Fastolff, of whech, aswell as of a bille askyd by on Fraunses  for makyng of houses in Southwerk, lete send hedir an answere; for and  I coud answere hem I wold not send to hym. And that Richard Calle, or  who so evir goo to hym of my seruauntes, lete hym vndirstand that such  brethelles as be abought Ser Thomas wene that I sent to hym for maters  of myn owne, and that I myght not forbere his frenship, whech is  no-thyng so; and if it lay in his power to avayle me an c li., as he can  not avayle me xx s., I wold not [deleted in MS] send to hym whill he is cuppilled with  such felaship as he is. Wherfore he that shuld speke with hym were best  to mete with hym at a sodeyn, where he were with some substanciall  man that coud informe hym what were his trought to do in the mater; for  it grevyth me full evill to send often to hym till he be of sadder  demenyng.  Item, if any answere I shall haue in this mater I must  haue it at the ferthest by that tyme as James Gresham shall come hedir,  for that tyme must I geve an answere; and if ye can get it ere, send it.  Item, if the seid Ser Thomas be of good disposicion lete hym be  spoke to that he be ware of the evidens of Dedham. He told John  Pampyng that he had byd John Russe deliuere hem me, and nough he is  turnyd and kepyth hem stille; and I dought lest by such as be abought  hym it shall rather be appeyrid thanne amendyd, for this xx wynter hath  Worseter vsed to bye and selle evidens. And ye can get hem of hym,  take hem.  Item, get yow copys of the jnquisicions take bifore  Master John Selot for Drayton chirch and bifore Edmond Clere,  exchetour, if any such were takyn; and also inquere what day Emond  Clere satte, for he is bound to put in the inquisicion with-in a monyth  after it is taken in the peyne of xl li.  Page \u00a0142\nItem, I sent yow word ye shuld inquere what bribes or rewardes  Edmond Clere toke of outlawed men in Norffolk, or any other fals  prattes that he hath doon. Dought ye nat he woll not answere of half the  good that he hath taken of outlawed men, if it were well inquered. James  Gresham shall cone telle where ye shall best inquere, and such as ye can  knowe send me iustly word.  Item, that the exspence mad by  Daubeney for myn howsold be mad vp, and that Daubeney be charged  with all such somes as ye or I or Richard Calle haue paijd for hym, and  ye for that he hath paijd for yow. As for that I paijd of that was  Daubeneys charge, I toke Calle therof a bille, wherof lete Calle send me  ayen a copy, and also send me the copy of the bille of your reseytes  whech ye haue hom with yow from hens; and that Daubeney and ye and  Call send me a remembrauns of the exspensis of myn housold and  yowres, your children, and the college, and all other foreyn paymentes,  and that in the makyng of Pecokkes acompt such thynges as he hath paijd  for the college or the housold be mad as mony deliuerid to Calle or  Daubeney, and that in ther acompt thei to aske alowaunce of the  paymentes by the handes of Pecok, for I woll no-thyng haue charged nor  discharged withinne the acomptes of any maners but only such as longyth  to the exspensis of the seid maners.  Item, that ye see all acomptes  be mad vp, and in especiall for my barly. Notwithstandyng, inasmoch  that ye haue had in moch barly and greynes for dettes of your tenauntes  of Mautby, therfore Pecokes acompt must be mad first, that such greynes  as he hath deliuerid may be charged vpon the maltster or vpon any other  that haue reseyved it.  Item, lete Pecokkes acompt be mad aftir the  forme of Norwodes acompt, as I suppose is wretyn in your bille of  erandes.  Item, take good heed at the charge and discharge of the  acompt of Fastolffes barly in all plases, for ye shall haue other increse  there thanne ye shall haue at Mautby; for the mesure of the barly in  diuers plases is gretter thanne the busshell at Caster, and also ye take an  hepe at the comb of fermes, whech in a gret somme castith out a gret.  Also the maltster must answere of the increse of maltyng acordyng to old  acomptes of Fastolffes, and if Calle can not vndirstand \u00feat wele  thanne ye may send for Barker; and ye shall, whan ye haue mad all  thyng redy to the acompt, for xl d. haue hym a day or ij, and he can as  good skyll theron  Page \u00a0143as Bernard can on his sheld. Notwithstandyng, the precedentes of  Fastolffes acomptes can telle it aswell as he if ther were any man coud  vndirstand it.  Item, on the day after your departyng I reseyved  lettirs by William Roo from your sones to me and to yow and to Richard  Calle, wherby on of hem writyth \u00feat my lord of Norwich, by the  meane of Master John Selot, had geue a jugement in the mater of the  presentacion for the chirche of Drayton or Euer [unclear] et cam thedir.  Neuirthelesse I wote well the Bisshop may geve no jugement, for ther  longyth no jugement to the mater. Paraventure he may amitte the Dukes  presentacion and leve myn, in which case I and Ser Thomas Howes must  take an accion ayens the Duc and the Bisshop and the prest, or ellis I  shuld lese the patronage. Neuirthelesse, as for the Bisshop, so ye lete  hym haue wetyng aforn secretly and in jentil wise, he woll take no  displeasir; for it must be do for eschuyng of a gretter hurt.  Notwithstandyng he shall bere no losse but if he woll. Wherfore send me  word betymes the very certeynt\u00e9 what is doon in this mater and  what is the prestes name that the Duc presentid, and what is the prestes  name that I presentid; and that Ser Thomas Howes be felt of his  disposicion, whedir he be of hert to take and abide by an accion, as it is  told me he woll. And if ye may fynd the meane that he may write a lettir  to yow or me therfore, or to speke to James Gresham therfore, and he be  thorougly felt in these maters aswell as in the maters wretyn in your bille  of erandes. Me thynkyth and he were comond with-all bifore the prior of  the White Freres, or some other frend of yours, it shuld cause hym to be  the more substanciall in his answere. Item, beware and remembir hough  Master John Selot hath deseyvid yow in this mater. Lerne wisdom therby  and forgete it neuir.  Item, your seid sones write hedir \u00feat  thei wold put some man in Cotton betymes, and \u00feat your yonger  sone seith he wold haue do it or this tyme but that he hath no mony in  his purs to pay for his costes thedir, wherfore he desirith to haue some  mony therfore till he myght gadir it vp. Wherfore, if thei be go or whan  thei goo, remembir hem that thei haue diuers tymes had mony  thedirward and do right nought, and myn aduersaries sent thedir men  without mony and had ther intent. Item, hough be it that Mighelmesse  payment may not be askyd till the day, yet ther is arerages jnough to  gader more thanne xx li., as it is told me.  Item, lete your sone  John the yonger wete \u00feat I reseyved his lettirs and billes for the  thyng \u00feat he serched fore, vndir his seall. Neuirthelesse   Page \u00a0144\nI remembir I fayle certeyn writyngges and skrowes on paper and  parchemyn touchyng the same mater, and in especiall of the obites and  beryin [deleted in MS]gis of diuers of the Poles and of on Pole was a wolle marchaunt  paijd gret customes to the Kyng; but I am in dought whedir your seid  sone lokyd not iustly ther in the box and bagge \u00feat I bad hym, or  ellis \u00feat it were medelid with some other skrowes in the same, or  ellis \u00feat it be in a bagge of like maters in my reed chyste at  Caster. Wherfore, if he may easely come ther-to without tarying of his  gretter maters, lete hym assay.  Item, he shall fynde a dede how  my fadir wass infeffid in \u00fee maner of Heylisdon and Drayton,  whech I suppose be among \u00fee euidens of Heylisdon wher I wole  haue \u00fee copy.  Item, he sendyth me word that ther is a prest  callid  told Ser William Barbour that he hath speciall evidens longyng to  the manoir of Drayton, and that he seid he wold I had hem, but he wold  speke with me. Wherfore I pray yow lete Ser William Barbour, with  some other frend of yours, goo speke with the seid prest and to fynd the  meane that he wold deliuer yow the seid evidens; and in case he woll not  deliuer hem till he [deleted in MS] hath spoke with me, thanne desire ye with some  frend of yours to see hem, and if ye seme thei be licly desire hym to  come to London with on of my men, and to pay for his costes to come  hedir to me, and quite his labour. But and ye may, take hem of hym,  though ye apoynt to take hem hym ayen or ellis to agree with hym  therfore. Neuirthelesse, in the begynnyng lete hym be told \u00feat ye  merveyll \u00feat he shuld haue any evidens of that maner, for ye herd  me sey \u00feat I had all the evidens of the maner. And lete this be do  by-tymes and wittely, and be ware \u00feat this be not do of a  sotilt\u00e9 to fele whedir \u00feat I wold inquere aftir any evidens  for faylyng.  Item, I pray yow remembir and rede often my bille of  erandes, and this lettir, till it be don; and all such maters or articles as  ye spede herof, crosse hem \u00feat ye may knowe hem from tho  \u00feat be not sped; and send me answere of your good speed.  Item, send me hedir the avise what your counsell thynkyth best  for the remedy of the chirch of Drayton.  Page \u00a0145Though I write right certeynly, if ye loke hem lightly and see hem seld  thei shall sone be forgete.  Item, I shall telle yow a tale: Pampyng  and I haue piked your male, and taken out pesis v, for vpon trust of  Calles promise we may sone onthryve. And if Calle bryng vs hedir xx  li., ye shall haue your peses ayen good and round; or ellis if he woll not  pay yow the valew of the peses there, to the post do nayle his ere, or  ellis do hym some other sorough, for I woll nomore in his defaut  borough; and but if the reseyvyng of my livelod be bettir plyed, he shall  Cristes curs and myn clene tryed. And loke ye be mery and take no  thought, for this ryme is cunnyngly wrought. My Lord Persy and all this  house recomaund them to yow, dogge, catte and mowse, and wysshe ye  had be here stille, for the sey ye are a good gille. Nomore to yow at this  tyme, but God hym saue \u00feat mad this ryme. Wret \u00fee vigill  of Sent Mathew [deleted in MS] be yowr trew and trusti husbond, J, P. "

After dewe recomendacion had, please you to wete that we cam to  London vppon the Tewysday by non nexst after oure departour fro  Norwich, and sent oure men to jnquyre after my lord Chaunceler and  Maister John Stokys and Malmesbury. And as for my lord Chaunceler,  he was departed fro London and was redyn to \u00fee Kyng ij dayes or  we were come to London; and as we vnderstand he hasted hym to  \u00fee Kyng by-cause of my Lord Ryuers takyng at Sandwyche,  &c. And as for Maister John Stokys, he was at Mortelak, wheder  we yede and spak wyth hym, and fond by hym by the begynnyng that he  had ben labored a-yens you, but by whom we coude not knowyn for he  wold not telle; but he sayd he was spoken to by on whiche he coude not  remembre \u00feat he schuld take good heed vppon the probat of my  maisters wyll how his londys schuld be gyded by-cause there was a  thyng ensealed as his wyll which was forged after my maisters decesse,  &c. But or we had thus moche of his confessyon we were resonably  well jn credens wyth hym; but it was long or we coude fynd hym  feythfully dysposed in oure conceytys. and whan we had hym resonably  after oure entent, we enfourmyd hym of Yeluerton nedeles wastyng of  my maister godys and the mystrust that he had jn hem hom my maister  most erthely trustyd, and how his desyre was synglerly to have had the  kepyng of Castre and all stuffe wyth-jnne it, and there to have lodged  hym-self; and also hou he dede meve my Lady Hevenyngham, &c.  Wherfore he avyseth you, for ony wrytyng or citacion that cometh fro  my lord of Caunterbury or fro hym, that ye your-self kepe the goodys  stylle and lete hym a-lone for the purvyans of all suche wrytyngys or  cytacions. We assked hym that, if Yeluerton wold not be refourmed,  wheder for the dyscharge of all your concyens a mene mygth be found to  a-voyde hym owte of the testament. And he sayd if he be fals to the dede  it is a cause resonable, and per-jur\u00e9 is a-no\u00feer cause; and  if ye woll Maister Stokys com to Norwiche for the probat, &c., he  woll com hym-self or make  Page \u00a0161a comyssyon to o\u00feer persones as ye woll assigne, or ell as many  as woll take charge wyth you to make a proxi,be it to me or to sum  o\u00feer,and send it hym and ye wyll ther-wyth, and it schall be  proved by that mene. And all the fauour \u00feat may be don for you  schall be don. And to your bargeyn he woll owe and do all the fauour  that he may wyth trouthe, and it schall not nede no wytnesse to youre  bargeyn wyth- oute ther be a contradiccion; and if ther be a  contradiccion iij or iiij wytnesse is j-now. And he hath no conceyte in  Yeluerton as now, and also but lytyll jn Fenyngley for the seruyce that  he oweth to my lord Tresorer, and o\u00feer causes whiche we  expresse not for cause of long wrytyng. And he avysed vs to go speke  wyth my Lord Chaunceler and Lord Beauchamp to wete wheder they  woll take ony charge or not, and to lete hym have knoweletch of ther  dysposycion. And he geveth you leve wyth a-no\u00feer executour, or  wyth youre owyn clerk, to mynystre and geve almesse at his perill. And  if he schuld com heder he had lever to com thes Fastegong tyde or after  Esterne than jn Lenton, but jn Lenton he schall com if ye thynk it  expedyent. And ther-for send vs word as ye woll we desyre hym jn that  poynt if it lyke you.  Item, ser, William Worceter was com to  London ij dayes or we were com, but we can not aspye openly that he  maketh ony labour, nor prevely nouther, be no maner of harkenyng nor  be no maner of talkyng; for I, Playter, have comonyd wyth hym and he  seyth rygth not, savyng that he woll be rewarded for his long trewe  seruice of my maisters good and lyke as my maister promyssed hym by  his lyffe. And euer more whan I sey vn-to hym that it may not be  gaynseyd but as touchyng to al my maister lond jn Norffolk and Suffolk  it is his wyll and suffycyant prove ther-vppon that ye schuld have it,  &c., and than he answereth and prayeth me no more to speke of  that mater for he vnderstand no...

But for God I fele by hym jn my conceyte that he  may help to save and gete a ml marc or to ml marc which wyth-oute his  help may not be saved, as he seyth. And to fele hym wheder he lyed or  seyd soth, I asked hym wheder he wold take that which mygth not be  saved wyth-owte his help for his reward, and he sayd ya, wyth good  wyll; and therfor wey ye all, &c.  Item, Ser Phelyp  Wentworth acte is passed the Kyng, whiche I doute not mygth not a be  with-oute my lord Chaunceler good wyll and assent; and William  Worceter sueth to have a copy therof, whiche he mygth have had of me  if he had lyst, &c.  Item, ser, I Playter speke wyth Maister  Yeluerton, and he taketh it  Page \u00a0162gretely to dysplesour that it was noysed that he and William Wayte  schuld have labored to an endyted Maister Th.

As for my lord Fortescu, we comond wyth hym seuerally, and  for to wryte all thyng of oure comonyng it were to long; but jn  conclusyon we vnderstand his good lordschip to you wardys, and all his  fauour wyth trouth, for that is his seyng.

As for tydyngys, my Lord Ryuers was brought to  Caleys and by-for the lordys wyth viij xx torches, and there my lord of  Salesbury reheted hym, callyng hym knaves son that he schuld be so  rude to calle hym and these o\u00feer lordys traytours, for they schull  be found the Kyngys treue liege men whan he schuld be found a  traytour, &c. And my lord of Warrewyk reheted hym and seyd that  his fader was but a squyer and broute vp wyth Kyng Herry the vte, and  sethen hym-self made by maryage and also made lord, and that it was  not his parte to have swyche langage of lordys beyng of the Kyngys  blood. And my lord of Marche reheted hym jn lyke wyse, and Ser  Antony was reheted for his langage of all iij lordys jn lyke wyse.  Item, the Kyng cometh to London ward, and as it is seyd rereth  the pepyll as he com; but \u00feis is certayn, ther be comyssyons made  jn-to dyuers schyres that euery man be redy jn his best aray to com whan  the Kyng send for hem.  plus jn tergo.Item, my Lord Roos is com fro Gynes.

Sir, it was tolde me by rythe a worshipfull  man that loveth you rythe well. and ve him. and ye xall knowe his name  hereafter, but put all things out of doubt he is such a man as will not lye.  On the xjth day of October the Kinge seid, 'We have sent two privy  sealys to Paston by two yeomen of our chamber, and he disobeyeth  \u00feem; but we will send him a-noder tomorrowe, and by Gods  mercye and if he come not then he xall dye for it. We will make all oder  men beware by him how they xall disobey our writinge. A servant of our  hath made a complainte of him. I cannot thinke that he hath informed us  all truely, yet not for that we will not suffer him to disobey our writinge;  but sithen he disobeyeth our writinge we may beleve the better his  gydinge is as we be informed'. And \u00feerwith he made a gret  a-vowe that if ye come not at the third  commandement ye xulde dye  therefore. This man that tolde me this is as well learned a man as any is  in England. And the same xjth day of October he advised me to send a  man to yow in all the hast that might be to lett yow have knowlache, and  that ye xulde not lett for none excuse, but that ye xulde make the man  good cheere and come as hastily ye might to the Kinge, for he  understandeth so much that the Kinge will kepe his promise.  Notwithstanding, by mine advice, if ye have this letter or the messenger  come to you, come to the Kinge wards or ye meete with him, and when  ye come ye must be suer of a great excuse. Also, if ye doe well, come  right stronge, for Howards wife made her bost that if any of her  husbands men might come to yow \u00feer xulde goe noe penny for  your life.; and Howard hath with the Kinge a great felloweship.   Page \u00a0202\nThis letter was written the same day that the Kinge said these words, and  the same day that it was told me, and that day was the xjth day of  October as abovesaid; and on the next morning send I forth a man to  yow with this letter, and on the same day send the Kinge the third privye  seale to you. Alsoe he \u00feat tolde me this seid that it were better for  yow to come upp then to be fotte out of your house with streingth, and  to abide the Kings judgement \u00feerin, for he will take your  contumacy to great displeasure. Also, as I understand, the Duke of  Norffolk hath made a great complaint of yow to the Kinge, and my Lord  of Suffolk and Howard and Wyngfelde helpe well to every day and call  upon the Kinge against yow. The Kinge is at this day at Grenewich, and  \u00feer will be still till the Parliament beginne. Some say he will goe  to Walsingham, but Master Sotyll seid in the Aulle in the Temple that he  harde no worde of any such pilgrimage. No more, &c. Written the  xjth day of October at midnight. My nevew John tolde me also that he  supposed \u00feer were out proclamacions against yow, &c., the  same day. By Clement Paston, your broder "

        "Content": "To my maystere John Paston the oldest be thys delyueryd in hast.  Ryght wyrshypfull husbond, I recomaund me vn-to you. Pleysed  you to wyte that on Wensday last passyd Dabeney, Naunton, Wykys, and  John Love werre at Drayton for to speke wyth youre tenauntys there, to  put hem in confort and for to aske money of hem also. And Pyrs Waryn,  otherwyse callyd Pyrs at Sloth, whych ys a flykeryng felowe and a besy  wyth Maister Phylyp and the bayly of Cosshay, he had a plowe goyng in  youre lond in Drayton, and there youre seyd seruauntys at that tyme toke  hys plowe-ware, that ys to say ij marys, and broght hem to Haylysdon,  and there they be yet. And on the next mornyng aftere Maister Phylyp  and the baylly of Cosshay com to Haylysdon wyth a grete nombere of  pepell, that ys to say viijxx men and more in harnysse, and there toke  Page \u00a0296\nfrom the parsouns plowe ij hors, prise iiij marc., and ij hors of Thomas  Stermyns plowe, prise xl s., sayng to hem that there was taken a playnt  a-yenst hem in the hunderd by the seyd Pyrs for takyng of the forseyd  plowarre at Drayton, and but thay wold be bond to com to Drayton on  Tewysday next comyng to awnswere to such maters as shalbe sayd to  them there they shold not haue there bestys a-yen; whych they refusyd to  do on-to the tyme that they had an awnswere from you. And so they led  the bestys forth to Drayton, and from Drayton forth to Cosshay. And the  same aftere-non folwyng the parson of Haylesdon send hys man to  Drayton wyth Stermyn for to speke wyth Maister Phylyp, to know a way  yf they shuld haue a-yen there catell or not. And Maister Phylyp  awnsweryd them yf that they wold bryng hom there destresse a-yen  \u00feat was taken of Pyrs Waryn, that then he wold delyuer hem  thers, or els not. And he lete hem playnly wyte that yf ye or any or  youre seruauntys toke any dystresse in Drayton, that were but the valew  of an hen, they wold com to Haylesdon and take ther the valew of an ox  there-fore; and yf thay cannot take the valew therof there, that then they  wyll do breke youre tenauntys howsys in Haylesdon and take as moch as  they cowd fynd there-in. And yf they be lettyd ther-of--wych shall neuer  lye in youre powere for to do, for the Duck of Suffolk ys abyll to kype  dayly in hys hows more men then Dabeney hadde herys in hys hede yf  hym lyst, and as for Dabeney he ys a lewde felow and so he shalbe  seruyd here-after, and I wold that he were hyre--and therfore he seyd yf  ye take vppon you to lette them so forto do, that then they wold goo  in-to any lyflode that ye had in Norffolk or Suffolk and to take a  destresse in lyke wysse as they wold do at Haylysdon. And othere  awnswerre cowde they non gyte, and so they departyd. Richard Calle  axid the parson and Stermyn yf they wold take an accyon for there  catell, and the parson seyd he was agyd and syklow and he wold not be  trobelyd herafter; he sayd he had leuer lose hys catell, for he wyst  well  yf he dyde so he shold be endytyd and so vexid wyth hem that he shold  neuer haue rest by hem. As for Stermyn, he sayd at that tyme he durst  not take no sute a-yenst hem nothere, but aftere that Richard was rydyn I  spake wyth hym and he sayd he wold be rulyd as ye wold haue hym; and  I fond hym ryght herty and wel dysposyd in that matere. And he is  bownde to you an obligacyon of x li. sengyll wyth-outen condycyon that  Page \u00a0297\nhe shall a-byde by such accyons as shalbe takyn by youre advyse in hys  name. Wherfore I haue send you a tytelyng therof in a byll closyd herin.  I axyd Thomas Gryne avyse when they had take the dystresse hyre, and  he avysyd me that herre destresse shold be delyueryd a-yen to them so  that we my\u021dt haue a-yen ourys; and me thoght it was non  awnswere after myn entent, and wold not therof but axyd avyse of  Skypwyth what hym thoght that were best to doo ther-in and most  wyrshypfull. He seyd by hys avyse that I shold send to you in al the hast  that I cowde, and that ye shuld fynde a mene therfore a-bove by the  avyse of youre lernyd counsell to haue a wrytte from a-bove for to  delyuer yt, of lesse then the vndershyrff werre otherre wysse dysposyd to  you then we fynde hym; for it symyth that he ys made of the othere  party. And as for the replevyn for the cc shype ys not yet servyd.  Skypwyth thynkyth that ye my\u021dt haue a wrytte bothe fore the  shype and the destresse now taken at Haylysdon. I pray you that ye wyll  send word in hast how ye [deleted in MS] woll that we doo in thys maters. Skypwyth  went wyth me to the Byshop of Norwych, and I lyte hym haue knowlych  of the ryotous and evyll dysposicyon of Maister Phylyp, desyryng hys  lordshyp that he wold see a mene that [deleted in MS] a correccyon my\u021dt be  hadde, in as moch as he was chyf justice of the peas and hys ordynare,  and in asmoch as he was a prest and vndere hys correccyon that he shold  haue vnderstondyng of hys dysposicyon; and I made Dabeney to tell hym  all the matere how it was. And he seyd he wold send for hym and speke  wyth hym, and he told me of dyuers thyngys of the demenyng of hym  wherby I vnderstode he lykyd not by hys dysposicyon nor demenyng in  thys mater nor in no nothyre, for it symyd he had provyd hym what he  ys in othere maters. My lord seyd to me that he wold ryght fayn that ye  had a gode conclusyon in youre maters, and seyd by hys trouth that he  ought you ryght gode wyll and wold ryght fayn that ye were com hom,  and seyd to me that it shold be a grete confort to youre frendys and  neghbors and that youre presens shold do more a-mongys hem than a c  of youre men shold do in youre absens, and more youre enmys wold  ferre to do a-yens you yf ye myght be at home and steryng a-mongys  hem; and seyd full playnly in meny othere thyngys it were to longe to  wryte at thys time, as Skypwyth shall tell you when he comy\u021dt to  you. I pray you thanke Skypwyth of hys gode wyll. for he was ryght  well wyllyd to go wyth me and yeve me hys avyse. Me thynkyth he ys  ry\u021dt well wyllyd to you.  Page \u00a0298\nItem, I pray you send hastely word how that ye wyll that we be  gydyd wyth thys place, for as it ys told me it ys lyke to stond in as grete  jupardy in hast as othere don.

Item, it ys told  me that Thomas Elys of Norwych, whych nowe ys chosyn mayere, seyd  at Drayton that yf my lord of Suffolk nede a c men he wold purvey hym  ther-of, and yf any men of the town wold go to Paston he wold do lay  hem faste in preson. I wold youre men myght [deleted in MS] haue a  \nsupersedias owte of the Chauncer\u00e9 and  be ovte of the dangere of there men here, and I pray you letnot Wyll  Naunton be for-yete there-in. Richard Call and othere can tell you of hys  demenyng, and I pray you that ye be not dysplesyd for hys a-bydyng  wyth me, for in gode feth he hath ben a grete confort to me syn ye  departyd hens, as I wyll lete you wyte herafter.

Item, I haue left John Paston the oldere at Castere to kype the  place there, as Richard can tell you, for I had levere, and it pleasyd you,  to be captenesse here then at Castere.

Please it  you to wyte that I recevyd letters from you on Wensday laste passyd the  were wryten the Monday next be-fore, wherof I thanke you of the lettere  that ye send to me. I wolde fayn doo well yf I cowde, and as I canne I  wol doo to youre pleasure and profet, and in such thyngys as I cannot  skyle of I wyll take avyse of such as I know that be youre frendys, and  doo as well as I canne. Where as ye wrote to me that Lydham told you  that I told hym that the Duckys men werre not so besy as thay had be  by-fore, no more thay were not at that tyme; but sythen they haue be  bysyere. What confort that thay haue I canne not haue no knowlych as  yet, but I suppose, and all youre felshyp were gode, thay sholdnot haue  so grete confort as thay haue, or ells thay wold not be so besy as thay  haue be. Grete bost they make that the Duck shold haue Drayton in peas,  and aftere thys Haylesdon, and that wyth-in short tyme. Thay ere moch  the boldere, I suppose, by-cause that ye be where as ye be. At the  reverens of God, yf ye may by any wyrshypfull or resonabell mene, com  ovte ther-of as sone as ye may, and com hom a-mongys youre frendys  and tenauntys, and that shold be to hem the grettyst confort that thay  my\u021dt haue and the contrary to youre enmys. It ys sayd here that  the Duck of Suffolk shall com to Coshay in haste and logge there for a  season. I fyle well by youre tenauntys that yf ye were peaseabyly  possessyd and youre cort holden in peaseabyll wyse, and that thay  my\u021dt be in pease a-yenst the othere many, than they wold take  accyons a-yenste hem for such wrongys as haue be don to hem. And ells  thay say that they thernot take it vppon hem, for they dwelle so ney to  the othere many that thay knowe well thay shold neuer be in ease yf thay  dyde soo whyle that thay dele a-mongys hem. On Thursday last John  Doket, the bayly ys son y lawe, and Thomas Ponte, wyth othere, erly in  the mornyng an ovre by-fore the sonne rose com to youre fold and drove  away the flock at Drayton, both colyet and othere, in-to Coshay fee or  euer that the shy [deleted in MS]pherd myght haue knowlych  Page \u00a0305therof. And than he fowlyd on and desyryd to haue hem a-yen, and thay  wold not suffere hym to haue them, no more but the colyet; and there  were c and j of yourys, and tho had thay forth wyth hem to Coshay. And  the same day we had a replevyn for the cc shype and replevyn for the  hors that were taken at Haylesdon, and how that thay were obbeyd  Richard Call shall enforme you, and of othere maters also the whych I  may not wryte to you of at thys tyme.  Item, I haue spoke wyth  John [unclear]  Strange of the matere that ye wrote to me of, and in gode feyth I  fynd hym, as me symyth, ryght well dysposyd to you wardys; and he  hath acordyng to youre desyre spoken wyth Yeluerton yesterday to fyle  hys dysposision in that matere, and Yeluerton, as it symyth by hym,  roght not gretely thogh the matere brake so that he myght haue any  resonabell colour to breke. He ys so callyd vppon by Wayte and othere  of the Duck of Suffolk ys counsell that he ote not where to hold hym,  and he ys put in so grete confort, as I am enformyd, to receve money for  the lond; and that temptyth hym ryght sore, for wyth money he wold  fayn be in handelyng, as ye know he hath nede therof. He told John  Straunge that it ys informyd hym that ye haue vp an enquest to deprove  there wytnesse, and there-wyth ys he sore movyd. ...

[unclear]  fore John  Straunge desyryd me that I shuld send to you in al haste that... [unclear]  any  such folkys that thay shold not doo in the matere tyll the day of ... [unclear]   may haue knowlych how he and othere wold doo in such maters as  sh... [unclear]  he wold be loth that he shold haue any colour to breke for any  thyng ...

[unclear]  eschewyng of wastfull expens of the  dede ys godys and that the godys my\u021dt be dyspendyd to the welle  of the dede. Straunge desyryd to knowe what appoyntementys he  desyryth to haue in the trety, and he sayd he wold not let that be  vnderstond tyll the tyme of trety cam. Me symyth, saue youre betere  avyse, it were wel do that thay that be com vp for you my\u021dt be  kypt in som secryte place and  Page \u00a0306not do in the matere tyll the tyme of the trety were passyd. The cost  there-of shall not be grete to that it my\u021dt hurte yf the trety were  broken by that meane. And there ye may haue hem nyere, and yf ye  thynk it be to doo ye may haue hem to go to there matere aftere the seyd  tyme, for of ij hurtys the grettyst ys best to be eschewyd.

And yf the houshold were  broke thay my\u021dt haue a gode excuse in that, who som euer com.  Richard Call shall enforme you of thys maters and mo othere more  playnly than I may do wryte at thys tyme. It ys necessary that  possessyon be kypt hyre yett tyll ye be more forthere forth in othere  maters.

And after I enformed the juges of ther vntrouthe and of ther  gidyng, and of oure gidyng in like wice, and after the juges vndrestod  the trouthe he gaue the baly of Cossey be-for me and many other a  passyng gret rebuke, seyng wythoute he amended hes condicion and  gouernaunce thei wold [unclear]  enforme the Kyng and helpe that he schuld be  punyschet. And wher as ye avyced me...

And as for kepyng  of any coorte for you at Drayton, I can not wete how it cowde be  brought a-boute wythoute helpe of other but if ther schuld growe gret  inconuenyence of it. And at the assises...

What schal be do ther I wot not yet, for as for any jndytementes that we  schuld labor a-yenst them, it is but wast werk, for the scheryf ner the  jurrours wol no thyng do  a-yenst them.  Item, wher as ye desire  to knowe what gentelmen wolde doo for you at this tyme, jn goode  feythe I founde Herry Greye, Lomnour, Alblastre, Wechyngham [unclear] ,  Berney of Redham, Skyppewyth, and Danyell of Mershelond ryght weele  disposed to you ward at this tyme in helpyng and in gevyng ther goode  avice to me for suche maters as I had to doo.

        "Content": "To my ryght wyrshypfull hosbond John Paston be thys delyueryd  in hast. Ryght wyrshypfull hosbond, I recomand me to you. Please it you  to wyte that I haue spoken wyth John Rus to doo youre erantys to the  parson of Blowfyld for such maters as be cleymed for Ser John Fastolf,  but I cannot send hym the byllys that ye send to me. I toke them to  Arblastere for to haue delyuerd to Ser Thomas, and he told me that he  had lefte the seyd byllys at hom wyth Blaunch hys doghtere. I send to  here for hem, and they cannot be founde; but I haue take John Rus the  namys of them that clayme the money, and he shall bryng you an  aunswere therof the wyke next aftere Hallawmasse.  Page \u00a0330I send you a lettere by Gryne the lodere which was wryten vppon  Wensday last, how that John Botelere and hys felowys were delyueryd  owte of prison. John Rus told me that Jenney ys sore be-hated wyth the  Duches of Suffolk and here sone for the matere that ys be-twyne John  Straunge and on of here men, and he dymeth, and othere moo, that it ys  the chyff cause of the brekyng vppe of houshold. It ys told me that  Jenney wyll be betere dysposyd to you wardys then he hath be byfore yf  he be spoken to of youre maters. Barthollomew Whyte hath be  straungely entretyd, and hys brothere and othere that com to record wyth  hym, and they were betyn and putte in prison and fovle revylyd by  Harleston and the bayly of Ey and othere of the Duck of Suffolk ys men.  But yf such thyngys as thay haue don may be chaystyd be-tyme men  dyme that thay wyll do more harme in haste. I was at Haylesdon vppon  Thorsday laste passyd and sey the place there, and in gode feyth there  wyll no cryature thynke how fowle and orubelly it ys a-rayed but yf they  sey it. There comyth moch pepyll dayly to wondere there-vppon both of  Norwych and of other placys, and they speke shamfully therof. The  Duck had be betere than a ml li. that it had neuer be don, and ye haue  the more gode wyll of the pepyll that it ys so foyll don. And thay made  youre tenauntys of Haylesdon and Drayton, wyth othere, to help to breke  down the wallys of the place and the logge both, God knowyth full evyll  a-yenst there wyllys but that they derst no nothere wysse don for ferre. I  haue spoken wyth youre tenauntys of Haylesdon and Drayton both, and  putte hem in confort as well as I canne. The Duck ys men rensackyd the  church and bare a-way all the gode that was lefte there, both of ourys  and of the tenauntys, and lefte not so moch but that they stode vppon the  hey awtere and ransackyd the jmages and toke a-way such as thay myght  fynd, and put a-way the parson owte of the church tyll thay had don, and  ransackyd euery mans hous in the town v or vj tymys. And the chyff  maysters of robbyng was the baylly of Ey, the baylly of Stradbroke,  Thomas Slyford. And Slyford was the chyff robbere of the cherch, and  he hath most of the robbory next the baylly of Ey, and as for lede, bras,  pewtere, yren, dorys, gatys, and othere stuffe of the hous, men of  Coshay and Cavston haue it, and that thay myght not cary thay haue  hewen it a-sondere in the most dysspytuose wyse. Yf it myght be I wold  som men of wyrshop myght be send from the Kyng to see how it ys both  there and at the logge, ore than any snowys com, that thay may make  report of the troth; ellys it shall not mo be seyn so playnly as it may  now. And at the reuerens of God, spyde youre maters nowe, for it ys to  orybell a cost and trobell that we haue now dayly and most haue tyll it  be othere-wyse; and youre men dere not goo a-bowte to gedere vppe  youre  Page \u00a0331lyfflode, and we kype here dayly more then xxx persons for sauacyon of  ous and the place, for in very trowght and the place hadnot be kypyd  strong the Duck had com hethere. The mayere of Norwych dede a-rest  the baylly of Normandys, Lovegold, Grygory Cordonere, and  Bartholomew Fullere wyth-ovten any autoryt\u00e9 saue only he sayth  that he hath a comandement of the Duck to do so; and he wyll not lete  hem ovte of prison tyll he had suerty for ache of hem in iiijxx li. for to  awnswere to such maters as the Duck and hys counsell wyll put a-yenst  hem at any tyme that thay be callyd, and so woll he do to othere, as  many as he may gyte, that awe you any gode wyll. And also the mayere  wold haue had hem sworen that thay shold neuer be a-yenst the Duck  nor non of hys, whych thay wold not do in no wyse. Pore Bartholomew  lyeth styll for defaute of suerty. He was som tyme moch tendyng to gode  Edmond Clyre. Arblastere thynketh verely that Hugh a Fen may do  moch in youre maters, and he thynkyth that he woll do for you faythfully  yf ye wyll, &c. At the reuerens of God, yf any wyrshypfull and  profetabill mene may be take yn youre maters, for-sake it not in  eschuyng of oure trobell and grete costys and chargys that we haue and  may growe here-aftere. It ys thoght here that yf my lord of Norffolk  wolld take vppon hym for you, and that he may haue a comyssyon for to  enquere of such ryottys and robboryes as hath be don to you and othere  in thys contray, that then all the contray wyll a-wayte vppon hym and  serue youre entent, for the pepyll lovyth and dredyth hym more then any  othere lord except the Kyng and my lord of Warwyk, &c.  Item, yf it please you, there ys on Harald of Haynford hath boght  a bond tenantry of yourys of on John Whyte, and the parson had it in  ferm be-fore that it was sold. And he sayth that yf it shold be sold that  he had a promyse of the awnere that he shold by it be-fore any othere  man; and the awnere sayth that he made hym neuer non soch promys,  nore recevyd neuer peny of hym for no bargyn. Wher-vppon I haue don  hym examyn a-fore the same parson and all the parysh, and there he  sware vppon a boke that he made neuer bargyng wyth no man saue only  wyth Harald; and Harald hath payd hym there-fore by-fore suffycyaunt  record and hath don coste vppon the hous sythen that he boght it, and  by-cause of evyll wyll that the parson awyth to hym he wold haue it  from hym, but the parson hath no gode record of hys bargyn. I pray you  thogh ye be enformyd by Richard Calle for the parson ys parte that ye  yffe no credans to hym therin, for ye shall here the matere youre-sylf  when ye com hom; for Richard holdyth more  Page \u00a0332wyth the parson for hys love then for the troght of the matere, and I  pray you that Harald may ocupy the land tyll the troght may be  vnderstond. And I pray you hertely send me word how ye do and how  ye spyde in youre maters in haste, and that I may haue knowlych how  youre sonnys doth. I com hom thys nyght late, and shalbe hyre tyll I  hyre othere tydyngys from you. Wykys com hom vppon Satore-day, but  he met not wyth youre sonys. God haue you in hys kypyng and send ous  gode tidyngys from you. Wryten in haste vppon the Seynt Symon and  Jude ys Evyn. By yourys M. P. "

Neuyrthelesse I remembere well that ye delt wythe ryght  delayous peple, my lord Archbyshop and othere of my lordys, and I  dempte by-cawse of youre long tarryng that by youre sad dyscrescyon all  hadde ben sett thorow. Neuer the lesse I vnderstond by youre wrytyng  that my lord of Norffolkys concell thynketh that hys entent whych ye  sertefyed me by  Page \u00a0403youre wrytyng sholde be more to hys wyrshop than the appoyntementys  and rewll made by the lordys of the Kyngys concell whych be to my  seyd lord of Norffolk nere kyne, whych appoyntementys sythen youre  departyng hath be largely remembryd a-mongys the seyd lordys here,  thynkyng it in hem-selff so honorabyll to my lord of Norffolk that there  shuld non off my lordys concell well avysed mevyd to the contrary.

I trowe he haue told you, and  yf he haue not the bryngere her-of schall in-forme you. And he broght  thys same appoyntement from my lord that my lord was well aggryed  that I shuld ocupye. For my parte, jff I shud take no othere apoyntement  but acordyng to youre letter it were hard for me and for my tytell to  putte my lord in that possessyon, for there ys thyngys in erthe to myn  esse in youre letter gode for me in that appoyntement, sauyng the suerty  off my brothere lyffe and my seruauntys whych ye thynke dowtefull yf  so be that they lakke stuff, shotte, and vytayll; mervaylyng sore and  thynk it jnpossybell jn thys shorte season, or in iiij tyme the season  hedere-towardys that thay shuld lakk, othere wythowte it soo be that my  lordys men haue enterd owght the place and so had there stuffe from  hem, whych I cannot thynk. Also, ser, for the tyme of youre comyng to  my lord of Norffolk seruauntys of <...> my modere at Norwych,  mouyng to send to my brothere hyre sone to delyuer the place vndere  such a forme as youre lettere specefyeth and so I cannot vnderstand what  regard myn lordys concell takyth to my lordys letter and to youre labour  in thys behalf but that thay offeryd as largely afore. \u021de wryteth in  youre lettere that ye durst nat passe youre credens. Please you to  remembere that seyd youre credens affore the lordys was ryght large,  and as large as myght well be in thys matere bothe to my lordys concell  of Norffolk to wyth-drawe the seege, wyth moore othere matere as ye  knowe, and to the justice of the peas and to the shyryff and hys offycers  youre awtoryt\u00e9 was grete j-now to jche of them. Wherfor,  Mayster Wretell, I neuer for thys nere \u021det wyll take appoyntement  in thys matere but as my lordys wyll and my lord Archbyshop, whych as  well as I my-selff haue holy putte oure tryst to youre dyscrete  dyreccyon; and my seyd lord syth [unclear] en youre departere, \u021doure  goyng, thynkyng you allys mete a man in executyng there comaundement  as cowde be chosyn. Neuer the lesse, for awnswere to you at thys season  my lord Archbyshop ys north-wardys towardys the Kyng, how be it it ys  seyd vppon a metyng wyth my lord of Clarens my lord shuld retourne  a-yen; and as \u021dester euyn he send a seruaunt of hys   Page \u00a0404\nto me, wenyng to hys lordshyp that Ser Humfray and ye were in Castere  as was appoynted, and ye shuld send to hys lordship answere of the  gydyng there by wrytyng, comaundyng me that yff any such wrytyngys  cam from you yf hys lordshyp wernot past iijxx myle from Lon [unclear] don to  com to hys lordshyp; wyth the same vnderstandyng for sertayn that he ys  nat yet so ferre. Wherefore I will in al the hast possybell ryde ny\u021dt  and day till I see hys lordshyp, and aftere cominicacyon had wyth hys  lordshyp, as sone as ys possybell that a man may go be-twext ye shall  haue an aunswere of hys dysposicyon; for hys jntres is such that as I  haue wryten I shall neuer do therin wyth-oute hym, as my cosyn,  bryngere herof, more playnly shall enforme you. For I canne thynke  ryght well that as \u021de wryteth to me my brodere wyll not delyuer  the place to non erthly person but yf he see wrytyng fro my lord. It  semyt be youre wrytyng that my lord of Norffolk consayll jntende not  that my lord Archbyshop shuld dele in thys matere, for he ys not named  in youre letter; wherof I mervayle, for it was movyd to you at youre  departyng hens the Kyngys concell shuld haue take dyreccyon in thys  matere or els my lord Cardenall, my lord of Clarens, my lord  Archbyshop, and my lord of Essex. Neuer the lesse, Mayster Wrytyll,  all profytht, maner, or lyfflod leyd apart, if it be so that thorow  reklesnese my brothere and seruauntys be in such jopart\u00e9 as ye  haue wryten to me, whych shold be half jnpossybell in my mynd that  thay shold myssvse so moch stuff in iiij tymes the space, and that ye  haue euydent knowlych by my seyd brothere hym-self thereof,i wold  praye yow to se hym and them in suert\u00e9 of there lyffys, what so  euer shold fall of the lyfflode.

The Kyng hathe ben in  thys contr\u00e9 and worchepfully receyuyd in-to Norwyche, and had  ryght good cher and gret gyftys in thys contr\u00e9, wherwythe he  holdyth hym so well content that he wyll hastyly be her agayn, and the  Qwen allso; wyth whom, by my power auyse, ye shall com if so be that  the terme be do by \u00feat tym \u00feat she com in-to \u00feis  contr\u00e9. And as for yowr maters her, so God help me, i haue don  as myche as in me was in laboryng of theym as well to my Lord Reuers  as to my Lord Scalys, Syr John Wydvyll, Thomas Wyngfeld, and othyr  abowt the Kyng. And as for the Lord Reuers, he seyd to myn oncyll  William, Fayirfax, and me that he shold meue the Kyng to spek to the  two dwkys of Norffolk and Suffolk that they shold leue of ther tytyls of  syche lond as wer Syr John Fastolffys, and if so be \u00feat they wold  do nowt at the Kyngys reqwest, \u00feat then the Kyng shold comand  theyn to do no wastys nor mak non assawtys nor frayis vpon yowyr  tenauntys nor plasys tyll syche tym as the lawe hathe determynd wyth  yow or ayenst yow. \u00feis was seyd by hym the sam day in the  mornyng that he depertyd at noon; whedyr he meuyd the Kyng wyth it  or nowt i can not seye. Myn oncyll Wylliam thynkys naye, and the same  aftyr-none  Page \u00a0544folowyng i told my Lord Scalys that i had spokyn wyth my lord hys  fadyr in lyek forme as i haue rehersyd, and axyd hym whedyr that my  lord hys fadyr had spokyn to the Kyng or nowt; and he gaue me thys  answer, that whedyr he had spokyn to the Kyng or nowt \u00feat the  mater shold do well j-now. Thomas Wyn [deleted in MS]gfeld told me and swore on-to  me that when Brandon meuyd the Kyng and besowght hym to shew my  lord fauour in hys maters ayenst yow, that the Kyng seyd on-to hym  a-yen, 'Brandon, thow thou can begyll the Dwk of Norffolk, and bryng  hym abowt [deleted in MS] the thombe as thow lyst, i let the wet thow shalt not do me  so, for i vndyrstand thy fals delyng well j-now.' And he seyd on-to hym  more-ouer that if my lord of Norffolk left not of hys hold of that mater  that Brandon shold repent itt euery veyn in hys hert; for he told hym that  he knew well j-now that he myght rewyll my lord of Norffolk as he  wold, and if my lord dyd enythyng that wer contrary to hys lawys, the  Kyng told hym he knew well j-now that it was by no bodys menys but  by hys; and thus he depertyd fro the Kyng.  Item, as by wordys  the Lord Scalys and Syr John Wydvyll tak tendyr your maters mor then  the Lord Reuers.  Item, Syr John Wydvyll told me when he was on  horsbak at the Kyngys depertyng that the Kyng had comandyd Brandon  of purpose to ryd forthe fro Norwyche to Lyne for to tak a conclusyon in  your mater for yow, and he bad me \u00feat i shold cast no dowghtys  but \u00feat ye shold haue your entent; and so dyd the Lord Scalys  also. And when \u00feat i preyd them at eny tyme to shew ther fauor  to your mater, they answerd that it was ther mater as well as your,  consyderyng the alyans betwyx yow. Comon wyth Jakys Hawt, and he  shall tell yow what langage was spoken be-twen the Duk of Suffolkys  consell and hym and me. It is to long to wryght, but i promyse yow ye  ar be-hold to Jakys, for he sparyd not to spek.  Item, the Kyng rod  thorow Heylysdon Waren towar [deleted in MS]dys Walsyn [deleted in MS]gham, and Thomas  Wyngfeld promysyd me that he wold fynd [unclear]  the menys that my lord of  Glowsestyr, and hym-sylf bothe, shold shew the Kyng the loge \u00feat  was broke down [unclear] , and also \u00feat they wold tell hym of \u00fee  brekyng down of \u00fee plase. Contrary to thys maters and all the [unclear]   comfort that i had of my Lord Scalys, Syr John Wydvyll, and Thomas  Wyn [deleted in MS]gfeld, myn oncyll Wylliam seythe that \u00fee Kyng told hym  hys owne mowthe when he had redyn forby the loge in Heylysdon  Waren that he supposyd as well \u00feat it myght falle downe by the  self as be plukyd downe, for if it had be plukyd down he seyd \u00feat  we myght haue put in ouyr byllys of it when hys  Page \u00a0545jugys sat on the oyeer determyner in Norwyche, he beyng ther. And then  myn oncyll seythe how that he answerd the Kyng that ye trustyd to hys  good grace that he shold set yow thorow wyth bothe \u00fee dwkys by  mene of tret\u00e9, and he seyth \u00feat the Kyng answerd hym  that he wold neythyr tret nor spek for yow but for to let the lawe proced;  and so he seyth that they depertyd. And by my trowthe, and my lord  Tresorer encorage yow not more then he dyd vs her, ye shall haue but  esy help as on \u00feat party; wherfor labor your maters effectually,  for by my trowthe it is ned, for, for all ther woordys of plesur, i cannot  vndyrstand what ther labor in thys contr\u00e9 hathe don good;  wherfor be not ouyr swyft tyll ye be swyr of your lond, but labor sore  \u00fee lawe, for by my trowthe tyll that be passyd wyth yow ye get  but esy help, as i can vndyrstand. I had wyth me on day at dener in my  modyrs plase, she beyng owt, the Lord Scalys, Syr John Wydvyll, Syr  John Haward, Nycolas Howard, John of Parr, Thomas Garnet, Fostwe  Cheyny, Trussell \u00fee knyghtys son, Thomas Boleyn,  \nqua propter, Brampton, Bernard, and Brom,  Perse Howse, W.

Item, my lord of Norffolk  gaue Bernard, Broom, nor me no gownys at thys seson, wherfor i  awaytyd not on hym; notwythstandyng i ofyrd my seruyse for \u00feat  seson to my lady, but it was refusyd, i wot by auyse. Wherfor i purpose  no more to do so. As for Bernard, Barney, Broom, and W. Calthorp ar  sworn my lord of Glowsetyrs men, but i stand yet at large not  wythstandyng my Lord Scalys spak to me to be wyth the Kyng; but i  mad no promes so to be, for i told hym \u00feat i was not woorthe a  groote wyth-owt yow, and therfor i wold mak no promes to no body tyll  they had your good wyll fyrst; and so we depertyd. It was told me  \u00feat ther was owt a preu\u00e9 seall for yow to attend vpon the  Kyng northeward, and if it be so i thynk veryly it is do to haue yow fro  London be craft, \u00feat ye shold not labor your maters to a  conclusyon thys terme but put them in [deleted in MS] delaye. I pray yow puruey yow  on it to be at hom as sone as the terme is doone, for be God i take gret  hurt for myn absence in dyuers plasys; and the most part of your men at  Caster wyll deperte wythowt abod and ye be not at hom wyth-in thys  fortnyght.

Thys man is meane of stature, yonge j-nough,  well wittyd, well manerd, a goodly yong man on horse and foote. He is  well spokyn jn Inglyshe, metly well in Frenshe, and verry parfite in  Flemyshe.

I shewed on-to hym that I had preyed Master Talbot to be  a mean to your good lordshepp for hym, and if so wer that Mastyr  Talbot thought that your lordshepp wer content to take hys servyse then,  that it wold please Mastyr Talbot to meve my lady of Norffolkys grace  to wryght  Page \u00a0601or send to Bernard puttyng hym in knowlage that hyr grace is content  that he shall become your menyall seruaunt; wherof he was passyng well  pleasyd.

And as it pleasyth your good lordshepe to  comand me in thes maters and all other, jf it may please your lordshepe  to shewe the same to my brodyr Nessfeld, he knowith who shall sonest  be wyth me to putt me in knowlage of your plesure, whyche I shall be at  all seasons redy t'accomplyshe to my poore power, wyth Godys grace,  whom I beseche longe to contenue the prosperous astate of your good  lordshepp. Fro Norwyche the second day of Marche, wyth the hand of  your most humble seruaunt and beedman John Paston "

Ryght worchepfull modyr, aftyr all dwt\u00e9s of humble  recomendacyon, in as humble wyse as I can I beseche yow of your dayly  blyssyng. Pleasyt yow to wett that at my being now at London, lyek as  ye gaue me in comandment I mevyd to Mastyr Pykenham and to Jamys  Hubart for ther being at Norwyche now thys Lent, that ye myght haue  ther avyses in syche maters as ye let me haue vndyrstandyng of. And as  for Mastyr Pykenham, he is now Juge of the Archys, and also he hathe  an other offyce whyche is callyd  auditor  causarum, and hys besyness is so gret in bothe thes offyces  that he can not tell the season when that he shall haue leyser to come  in-to Norffolk; but I left not tyll I had gotyn Jamys Hubbart and hym  to-gedyrs, and then I told theym your jntent. And then Mastyr Pykenham  told Jamys and me hys jntent, and he preyed Jamys that he shold in no  wyse fayle to be wyth yow thys Lent. Not wythstandyng it was no gret  ned to prey hym myche, for he told Doctore Pykenham that ther was no  gentylwoman in Inglond of so lytyll aqueyntance as he had wyth yow  that he wold be  Page \u00a0613glader to do servyse on-to, and myche the glader for he purposeth fro  hensforthe duryng hys lyff to be a Norffolk man and to lye wyth-in ij  myle of Loddon, whyche is but viij or x myle at the most fro Mautby.  And in conclusyon he hathe appoyntyd to awayte on yow at Norwyche  the weke next aftyr Mydlent Sonday, all the hole weke if nede be, all  other maters leyd apart. Also I comond wyth my brodyr Syr John at  London of syche maters as ye wold haue amendyd in the bylle that he  sent on-to yow, and he stake not gretly at it. Also, modyr, I herd whyle  I was in London wher was a goodly yong woman to mary whyche was  doughter to on Seff, a merser, and she shall haue cc li. in money to hyr  maryage and xx mark by yer of lond aftyr the dyssease of a  steppe-modyr of hyrs whyche is vpon l yer of age. And or I departyd  ought of London I spak wyth some of the maydys frendys, and haue  gotyn ther good wyllys to haue hyr maryd to my brodyr Edmund.  Notwythstandyng those frendys of the maydys that I comond wyth  avysyd me to get the good wyll of on Sturmyn, whyche is in Mastyr  Pykenhamys danger so myche that he is glad to please hym. And so I  mevyd thys mater to Mastyr Pykenham, and jncontynent he sent for  Sturmyn and desyred hys good wyll for my brodyr Edmun [deleted in MS]d, and he  grantyd hym hys good wyll so that he koud get the good wyll of the  remenaunt that wer executours to Seff, as well as the seyd Sturmyn was;  and thusferforthe is the mater. Wherfor, modyr, we must beseche yow to  helpe vs forward wyth a lettyr fro yow to Mastyr Pykenham to  remembyr hym for to handyll well and dylygently thys mater now thys  Lent. And for I am aqueyntyd wyth your condycyons of old, that ye reke  not who endytyth more lettres then ye, ther-for I haue drawyn a note to  yowr secretarys hand Freir Perse, whyche lettre we must prey yow to  send vs by the berer herof, and I trust it shall not be longe fro Mastyr  Pykenham. Your doughtyr of Sweynsthorp and hyr soiornaunt E. Paston  recomandyth hem to yow in ther most humble wyse, lowly besechyng  yow of your blyssyng.

And  so the drevyll lost hys thank of vs, and yet abod nevyr the lesse. Youyr  doughtyr sendyth yow part of syche poore stuff as I sent hyr fro London,  besechyng yow to take it in gree though it be lytyll plent\u00e9 that  she sendyth yow.

Syr, aftyr all dut\u00e9s of recomendacyon, pleasyt to  vndyrstand that, acordyng to your lettre sent me by Wyllson, Lomnore  and I mett at Norwyche and drew ought a formable bylle ought of your,  and sent it a-yen to th'exchetore Palmer by my brodyr Edmund, whyche  had an other erand in-to that contr\u00e9 to spek wyth H. Spylman to  get hys good wyll towardys the bargayn lyek to be fynyshed hastyly  betwyx Mastress Clyppysby and hym. And, syr, at the delyuer\u00e9  of the bylle of jnquisicyon to th'exchetour, my brodyr Edmun [deleted in MS]d told  hym that, accordyng to your wryghtyng to me, I spak wyth myn oncle  William and told hym that I vndyrstood by yow that my lord of Elye had  aswell desyred hym in wryghtyng as you by mouthe that non of you  shold swe to haue the jnquisycion fond aftyr your jntentys tyll other  weyes of pese wer takyn betwyx yow; wherfor my brodyr Edmun [deleted in MS]d  desyred hym that wyth-ought myn oncle labord to haue it fond for hym,  ellys that he shold not proced for yow. But th'exchetour answerd hym  that he wold fynd it for you aftyr your byll of hys owne autorit\u00e9,  and so it was  Page \u00a0615fond. But, syr, ye must remembre that my lord of Ely desyred myn  oncle as well as you to surcease, as I putt my oncle in knowlage. And  myn oncle at the fyrst agreid that he wold make no more sute a-bought  it, in trust that ye wold do the same acordyng to my lord of Elys desyer;  wherfor ye had ned to be ware that th'exchetor slyppe not fro yow when  he comyth to London and sertyfye it or ye spek wyth hym. Th'exchetor  shalbe at London by Twysday or Wednysday next comyng, at John Leeis  house, for he shall ryd forwardys as on Monday next comyng betymys,  &c. Syr, your tenauntys at Crowmer sey that they know not who  shalbe ther lord; they marvayll that ye nor no man for yow hathe not yet  ben there. Also, when I was wyth myn oncle I had a longe pystyll of  hym that ye had sent Pekok to Paston and comandyd the tenauntys ther  that they shold pay non areragys to hym but if they wer bond to hym by  oblygacyon for the same. Myn oncle seythe it was other-wyse apoyntyd  be-for the arbytrorys. They thought, he seyth, as well my Mastyr  Fytzwalter as other, that he shold receyue that as it myght be gadryd; but  now he seythe that he wottyth well some shall renne awey and some  shall wast it, so that it is nevyr lyek to be gadryd, but lost. And so I  trow it is lyek to be of some of the dettors, what for casuelt\u00e9 of  dethe and thes other causes befor rehersyd. Wherfor me thynkyth if it  wer apoyntyd be-for the arbytrors that he shold receyue theym as he  seythe, it wer not for yow to brek it; or ellys if he be pleyn executor to  my grauntdam then also he ought to haue it. I spek lyek a blynd man.  Do ye as ye thynk, for I was at no syche apoyntment befor th'arbytrors,  nor I know not whethyr he is executor to my grauntdam or not but by  hys seying. Also, syr, ye must of ryght, consyderyng my brodyr  Edmundys diligence in your maters sythe your departyng, helpe hym  forwardys to myn oncle Syr George Brown, as my brodyr Edmun [deleted in MS]d  preyid yow in hys lettyr that he sent on-to yow by Mondys sone of  Norwyche, dwellyng wyth Thomas Jenney, that myn oncle Syr George  may gett to my brodyr Edmund of the kyng \u00fee wardshepp of John  Clyppysby, son and heyer to John Clyppysby, late of Owby in the  cont\u00e9 of Norffolk, sqwyr, dwryng the nonnage of my lord and  lady of York, thow it cost iiij or v mark the swte. Let myn oncle Syr  George be clerk of the hamper and kepe the patent, if it be grantyd, tyll  he haue hys mon\u00e9, and that shall not be longe to. Myn oncle Syr  George may enforme the Kyng for trowthe that the chyld shall haue no  lond dwryng hys yong modyrs lyff, and ther is no man her that wyll  mary wyth hym wyth-ought they haue some lond wyth hym; and so te  gyft shall not be gret that the Kyng shold geve hym. And yet I trow he  shold get the  Page \u00a0616modyr by that meane, and in my conseyt the Kyng dothe but ryght if he  graunt my brodyr Edmun [deleted in MS]d Clyppysbys son in recompence for takyng  my brodyr Edmundys son, otherwyse callyd Dyxsons, the chyldys fadyr  being alyve. Dyxson is ded, God haue hys sowle, whom I beseche to  send you your most desyred joye. Wretyn at Norwyche on Seynt  Leonardys Day. J. Paston Syr, it is told me \u00feat Nycolas Barlee,  the scyuer, hathe takyn an axion of dett ayenst me thys terme. I prey  yow let Whetley or some body spek wyth hym and lete hym wet that if  he swe me softly thys terme that he shall be payed or the next terme be  at an end. It is a-bought vj li., and in feythe he shold haue had it or thys  tyme and our threshers of Sweynsthorp had not dyed vpp. And if I  myght haue payed it hym a yer ago, as well as I trust I shall sone aftyr  Crystmass, I wold not for xij li. haue brokyn hym so many promessys as  I haue. Also, syr, I prey yow send me by the next man that comyth fro  London ij pottys of tryacle of Jenne = they shall cost xvj d.; for I haue  spend ought that I had wyth my yong wyff and my yong folkys and  my-sylff. And I shall pay hym that shall bryng hem to me, and for hys  caryage. I prey yow lett it be sped. The pepyll dyeth sore in Norwyche,  and specyally a-bought my house; but my wyff and my women come not  ought, and fle ferther we can not, for at Sweynsthorp sythe my  departyng thens they haue dyed and ben syke nye jn every house of the  towne.

Inasmoch as it hath liked God to sende vs good tidinges oute of Bretayn  such as we dought not but that ye be desirous to vndrestonde, we wryte  vnto you of them as thay be comen to oure knowlage, and as foloueth.  The Lord Malpertuis, now late wyth vs in ambassade from oure dere  cousine the Duchesse of Bretayne, shippid at oure porte of Dortmouth  and arriued at Saynt Powle de Lyon in Bretayn on Palmesonday at iiij  aftere noone, from whens he wrote vs the disposicion and the state of the  countr\u00e9 there, and of the landyng and the demeanyng of oure  armee.

In that castell was also a garnisson of  Frenshemen, which incontinently vpon worde that oure said armee drwe  towardes theym the Frenshmen did cast downe gret parte of the walles  and fled from thens. In that castell and borugh oure seid armee kept  thaire Estre. The castell of Chawson adioyn [deleted in MS]ing ner to the towne of  Saynt Bryak was also garnisond wyth Frenshmen. That castell they set  on fire and soo fled. And the townes of Henebone and Vannes were  garnisond wyth Frenshmen, which breke downe the walles of the townes  and putte themselff to fligth. Th'inhabitauntes a-bought Brest haue layd  siege thereunto, and goten the base courte of the Frenshmen or the  departyng of oure said pursiuaunt.

Sere, the cause of my wrytyng to you at this tyme: on Friday att nyght  last past come Alexander Wharton, John Hous, and John Fylle, wyth ij  good cartys well mannyd and horsyd wyth hem, to Marlyngford, and  there at \u00fee maner of Marlyngford and at the mille lodyn bothe  cartys wyth mestlyon and whete, and betymys on Saturday in the  mornyng they departyd fro Marlyngford towardys Bongey, as it is seyd;  for the seyd cartys come fro Bongey, as I soppose by the sendyng of  Bryon, for he goth hastyly ouer \u00fee se, as it is seyd, and as I  suppose he wyll haue the mestlyon ouer wyth hym, for the most part of  the cart loodys was mestlyon, &c.  Item, ser, on Saturday last  past I spacke wyth my cosyn Gornay, and he seyd if I wold goo to my  lady of Norffolk and besech hyr good grace to be youre good and  gracyous lady, she wold so be; for he seyd that on word of a woman  shuld do more than the wordys of xx men, yiffe I coude rewyll   Page \u00a0666\nmy tonge and speke non harme of myn vnkyll. And if ye comaund me  for to do, I trist I shuld sey nothyng to my ladys displesure, but to youre  profyt; for me thynkyth by the wordys of them, and of youre good  fermore of Oxned, that they wyll sone drawe to an ende; for he cursyth  the tyme that euer he come in the ferme of Oxned, for he seyth  \u00feat he wotyth well that he shall haue a grette losse, and yet he  wyll not be aknowyn wheder he hathe payd or nought; but whan he seth  his tyme he wyll sey trowth. I vnderstond by my seyd cosyn Gornay that  my lady is nere wery of hyr parte, and he seyth my lady shal come on  pylgremage in-to this towne, but he knowyth not wheder afore Cristmes  or aftyr; and if I wold thanne gete my Lady Calthorpe, my moder in  lawe, and my moder and my-selfe, and come before my lady besychyng  hyr to be youre good and gracyous lady, he thynkyth ye shull haue an  ende, for fayne she wold be redde of it, wyth hyr onowre sauyd, but  yette money she wold haue. Nomore to you at this tyme, butte I mervell  sore that I haue no letter from you. I prey God preserve you and send  me good tydyngys from you, and spede you well in youre materys. And  as for me, I haue gotyn me anothyr logyn felawe; the ferst letter of hyr  name is Mastras Byschoppe. She recomaundyth hyr to you by the same  tokyn that ye wold haue had a tokyn to my mayster Bryon. Att Norwych  the Sonday next after the fest of All Seyntys. Be yowre seruaunt and  bedewoman Margery Paston "
